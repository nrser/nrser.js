version
-------

this is the `0.2.X` branch (developed as master while it's the head). it's still in heavy development.

the primary change from the `0.1` branch is that it replaces the `lib/gulpTasks.js` functionality with `ugh`. the `0.1` branch exists to avoid migrating packages that depend on it until desired and facilitate occasional quick fixes.
